Project 4: UiPath

Using this project you can clone the repository from github.
Open the folder and opening the Main xml file and running it from there.

Two problems I have encountered is:
1) My program is linear, and I have assumed that form my updates the attributes will be listed from the most rescently created ones. which is not the case and I have not accounted for. Thus when updating the attributes from zone, category and devices the updates will be lost. In the case that the elements would display the most recent element the program will work fine.

2) The second problem is that you need to start the program while logged out of the website as my login process only accounts for being logged out of the website.


Also please find the attatchment for the publication included in the files.
